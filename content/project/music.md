my collaborators and I constructed one of the most accurate empirical models of Milky Way stellar number density, metallicity, and kinematics, and demonstrated the feasibility of directly mapping the Milky Way using the wide- area, multi-band, photometric data set such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).
Using the photometric parallax method, Juric et al. (2008) estimated the distances to ~48M main-sequence stars observed by the SDSS, mapped their three-dimensional number density distribution, and produced three- dimensional maps of Galactic stellar number density at heliocentric distances from 100 pc to 20 kpc. These maps are a departure from the traditional methods of forward-modeling of star counts, in which counts in color-magnitude space are fitted to models that rely on a number of poorly constrained functions: the mass function, mass-luminosity relation, and density laws of the postulated components (e.g. exponentials and power laws). Instead, using the density maps the Milky Way's structure can now be studied with few a priori assumptions about its components. Indeed, with our data the need for each component, and its properties, is determined a-posteriori from the data rather than a priori from a set of input assumptions. Such maps can also be more directly compared to simulations, which predict structure and substructure significantly more complex than the simple analytic models traditionally used to describe the Milky Way.
