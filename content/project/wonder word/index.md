One of my open-source projects is wonder-word, a terminal application for vocabulary training for OSX and Linux using Web Scraping, a technique for web data extraction. The project is available on Github. The idea for this tool came up when I was preparing for GRE while working in a startup. It was diﬃcult for me to ﬁnd time from a hectic job schedule for GRE preparation. So, I built this tool that pops up a new GRE word every time I open my terminal for doing programming in my job sessions. It helped broaden my vocabulary while doing my job.
