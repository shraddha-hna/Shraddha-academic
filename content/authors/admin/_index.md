I am a data scientist at the Biofourmis Pvt. Ltd.,where I am part of the ECG team and work on early detection of heart abnormalities. My research interests include signal processing, machine learning, linear algebra, and music/biomedical signal processing. Besides academic interests, I am a passionate dancer and love singing.
